~~* When it comes to instantiating databases, we need to do it **after** the connection has been established with the real database.~~
* Maybe implement an abstract system with databases as well as data, so whenever new forms of data will be created in the future,
it will be easier to implement them. [This is a must because noticably theere are similar properties]
