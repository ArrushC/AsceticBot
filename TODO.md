# Todo list:
~~- Make the command system a bit more smarter - if a command fails to run, then it should not run globally.~~
- Add music
- Make a guild and user config system, depending on what type of database is used.
- With the new configs established, maybe consider adding new features such as games or idk.
- Add appropriate documentation for each command and method.
